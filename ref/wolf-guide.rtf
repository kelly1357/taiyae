In the real world, gray wolves can be found in the northwest United States and Canada. Given the setting of our story (the Pacific Northwest), the gray wolf is the only species of wolf that would realistically inhabit the area.</p><p>The species lupus (wolves) includes many known subspecies, eleven of which are playable at Horizon:</p><div class="overflow-x-auto my-4"><table class="w-full text-xs border border-gray-300"><tbody><tr class="border-b border-gray-300"><td style="font-size:10px; color:#8a8a8a; width: 25%; text-transform:uppercase;" class="border-b border-gray-300 bg-gray-100">EASTERN TIMBER WOLF</td><td class="py-2 px-3"><strong><em>Canis lupus lycaon</em></strong> \'97 Most common.

However, Horizon is set during the human decade of the 1900s, so species like the Great Plains wolf become playable to us.</p><h3>Lifespan</h3><p>Healthy wolves in Horizon have an average lifespan of 6-9 years. In the real world, wolves have been found to live as old as 11, but it is rare that wolves in this roleplay will reach or exceed this age.

Blue and green eyes are rarer - green are hardly encountered in the real world - but for the sake of our roleplay, we allow these colors of eyes to increase diversity*.

While color changes that do not move into unnatural territory (see above), natural markings, and minor or subtle unique markings are still allowed, anything that drastically takes the wolf outside of what might be found in nature will be declined. Staff will take edits into consideration on a case-by-case basis, in which the quality of the manipulation and how natural it appears may affect the final decision. Any wolves with extreme markings previously in play as of January 10th, 2018 are exempt from this rule, though future offspring of these exempt wolves will be required to follow the new standard.</p><p>*In order to try to preserve realism, we don't allow characters with pink, purple, or red eyes.</p><p>*We no longer accept albino wolves due to rarity and no known instance of albino wolves in real life.</p><p>If you have any questions about character design, feel free to bring it up with staff.</p><h2>Packs</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>In Horizon, packs are created in character. There are currently ten <a class="font-bold" href="/wiki/pack-creation" data-discover="true">packs in Horizon</a>. For information about how packs are created, check out the <a class="font-bold" href="/wiki/pack-creation" data-discover="true">Pack Creation</a> wiki page.</p><p>A pack must have at least four members, but there is no upper limit to the amount of wolves a pack can have. They start out with one subarea, which they can either claim or create themselves, and are limited to as many subareas as they can control. For example, a pack with four members will likely not be able to reliably defend more than one subarea if their claim to it is challenged.</p><h3>Ranks</h3><p>Ranks in Horizon are comprised of two parts: position (a Roman numeral) and title (like "leader" or "hunter"). Example: "I. Alpha" or "III. Hunter"</p><p><em>Positions</em>\'97 Wolves in packs are ranked according to numerical order in Roman numerals. The highest-ranked wolf or wolves will hold a rank of "I," the next lowest "II," and so on. These position rankings typically convey the order of dominance/leadership within the pack, though they may carry other connotations based on each pack's unique hierarchial structure.</p><p><em>Titles</em>\'97 In addition to position in the pack, ranks also carry titles, such as "leader" or "pupsitter." Titles often carry meaning based on that wolf's role in the pack. Titles can be descriptive (such as "ambassador"), but they may also carry abstract names. Pack founders/leaders are free to change their pack's titles as they see fit, and may determine structure as necessary.</p><h3>Challenges</h3><p>Challenges occur when a wolf wishes to rise in his pack's ranks. A challenge can be anything from a verbal conversation to a full-blown fight\'97 the terms depend on any pack policies regarding challenges, as well as the challenger/challengee's individual personalities. As per <a class="font-bold" href="/wiki/rules-general" data-discover="true">Horizon rules</a>, all rank challenges must be responded to within three OOC days unless the character being challenged has already been placed on absence. Any rank (including leadership) in any pack may be challenged.</p><h3>Borders, marking, and pack etiquette</h3><p>A wolf pack marks the boundaries of its territory by spraying scent (urine) on trees, rocks, or other objects of interest. In this roleplay, it is to be assumed that all pack territories have already been marked by their respective leaders, so marking in posts is encouraged, but not required. In Horizon, as in most other wolf roleplays, the scent of a pack is descriptive of that pack's numbers, setting, and other traits.</p><p>Most wolves in the real world try to avoid venturing into other packs' territory as much as possible - instinct tells them that they'll probably be killed for straying into terrain owned by someone else. However, in this roleplay, our wolves are personified as creatures who harbor emotion and have complex histories. Since our wolves will have grudges, vengeful thoughts, or, on the other hand, alliances or other positive bonds, interpack relations will depend on the motives of our characters. This does not mean our characters will completely abandon respect, though.</p><p>To respect your neighboring pack, wait at the border until you are greeted. Be respectful to your greeter, for once you are standing even an inch within their territory boundaries, you are in their jaws. Wandering in others' territory is not a wise idea - however, some characters may make exceptions: for example, a pack leader who finds his sister wandering through his woods might welcome her warmly instead of tearing her limb from limb. However, you are free to try your luck wandering in a pack territory if you are willing to risk your character's life! In our roleplay, some packs are more peaceful than others, and may treat trespassers differently.</p><h2>Reproduction</h2><h3>Forming pairs</h3><p>Instincts drive real wild wolves to form pairs and mate; in this roleplay, our characters have more complex emotions and drives as if they are humans falling in love. That said, although wolves have long been considered monogamous (as in, they mate for life), this is not always the case. Wolves are about as monogamous (or, in some cases, non-monogamous) as humans are. Sometimes, a pair will mate for life, where other times, a male may breed with two or three different females over the course of his lifetime.</p><p>Before wolves mate, they pair up with a partner of the opposite sex in whom they have begun to take interest. The two wolves, a male and a female, will, night by night, sleep closer together and begin to show loving signs of affection such as nuzzles, cuddling, and so on. This may occur before the wolves reach sexual maturity.</p><p>Although this is different in all wolves, some are physically capable of reproduction by 1.5 years (1 year, 6 months) of age at the absolute earliest.</p><h3>Mating</h3><p>Mating season begins in Early Winter and ends in Late Winter.</p><p>If she has reached sexual maturity, the female will go into heat for approximately 2 weeks between Early Winter and Late Winter. During this time she often travels with her mate nearby, and when they are alone, mating occurs.* Pairs about to mate will often run off into a secluded area to avoid harassment from other pack members. Mating in wolves occurs as it does in dogs.</p><p>*Don't roleplay this out - you can just sort of "time warp" to after it has happened.</p><h3>Dens</h3><p>Contrary to popular belief, wolves do not reside in dens year round. A family will begin preparing a den (or multiple dens in case one is flooded or otherwise becomes unusable) as soon as a mother begins expecting pups. When her litter is born, she and the pups live in the den for eight weeks - after this, the den is abandoned.</p><h2>Maternity</h2><div class="my-4"><a href="https://taiyaefiles.blob.core.windows.net/web/nnOO3iw.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="cursor-pointer"><img alt="Maternity Timeline - Click to enlarge" class="w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto hover:opacity-90 transition-opacity" src="https://taiyaefiles.blob.core.windows.net/web/nnOO3iw.jpg"></a><p class="text-center text-gray-500 text-xs mt-1">Click image to enlarge</p></div><p>After the heat ends and the female has successfully conceived, she will undergo several bodily changes, especially beginning in her third week. (It's virtually impossible for wolves to detect pregnancy before this point!)</p><p>The gestation period in wolves is about 63 days (two months). Pups are born any time from Early Spring to Late Spring, with the exception of litters dangerously conceived before or after mating season officially began.</p><p>Following early pup care, wolves generally exist in a low hormonal state from summer to late autumn and cannot conceive a litter until the next winter.</p><p><em>Important:</em> Wolves may only become pregnant in-character. You may not join Horizon with a pregnant wolf.</p><h3 class="text-xs font-normal uppercase tracking-wider text-gray-500 border-b border-gray-300 pb-1 mb-4 mt-8">Pup Development</h3><div class="bg-[#e5ebd4] px-4 py-3"><div class="text-gray-800 text-[13px] text-left"><span class="text-[#81973b]"><p><center>See the <a class="font-bold" href="/wiki/wolf-guide-pup-development" data-discover="true">Pup Development Guide</a> for guidelines for playing pup characters as they age.</center></span></div></div></p></div><p>Litters usually consist of 4-6 pups - this is quite a large number of pups to play out, so for the purpose of our roleplay, wolves in Horizon will usually birth litters of 2-4 pups. The size of the litter is randomized by staff, who will perform a die roll to determine the number and gender of pups. Health of the parents and other factors may affect litter size.</p><p>Wolves may not reach full physical and emotional maturity - comparable to a 25 or 30 year old human - until about four or five years of age. However, they may reach sexual maturity much earlier, at one or two years of age.</p><p><em>Important:</em> Pups 6 months or younger cannot enter horizon. Characters not born in Horizon in-character must be 7 months or older. Since young pups wouldn't realistically be able to survive a journey through, say, Eastern Wasteland, this ensures a logical chance of having survived to get here.</p><p><em>Think the Wolf Guide is missing some information, or do you have any questions?
