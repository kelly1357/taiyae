They are similar to character alignments in other RPGs. They are not concrete, and you may follow them as you wish. Your wolf may behave as a perfect example of his Spirit Symbol, or he may deviate from specific characteristics of his Symbol.</p><p class="mb-4"><strong><a class="text-[#2f3a2f] hover:underline" href="/wiki/spirit-symbol-quiz" data-discover="true">Take the Spirit Symbol quiz to determine your character's Symbol.</a></strong></p><p class="mb-4">You may take the quiz as many times as you want, as your character's values and tendencies are likely to change over time. However, keep in mind that the quiz is meant to decide your character's symbol for you\'97 not the other way around.</p><p class="mb-6">There are nine possible Symbols:</p><div class="mb-6 overflow-hidden"><img style="margin-top:50px; padding: 30px; width: 125px" alt="Hoof Symbol" class="float-right ml-4 mb-2 mt-[52px] w-16" src="https://taiyaefiles.blob.core.windows.net/web/hoof_d.png"><h2>Hoof</h2><p class="mb-2">Committed to serving the greater good through order and loyalty, a Hoof is compassionate and fiercely loyal to those he serves.</p><p class="mb-2">He operates behind a strong moral compass or personal code of honor, and endeavors to protect those weaker than him. As a result, he will only kill out of loyalty, to defend those to whom he's sworn (whether it be his pack, his family, or the innocents of the world). He likely believes in justice where it is due. He will rarely, if ever, tell a lie.</p><p class="mb-2">He believes there is order to the world, and that upholding this order is necessary for there to be good in the world. Discipline and respect are musts for him. He accepts that to contribute to order, one has to sacrifice personal freedom.</p><p class="mb-2">He will likely flourish within a structured hierarchy, since he is cooperative by nature and values organization (for example, a poorly-planned hunt may irritate him).</p></div><div class="clear-both"></div><div class="mb-6 overflow-hidden"><img style="margin-top:50px; padding: 30px; width: 125px" alt="Leaf Symbol" class="float-right ml-4 mb-2 mt-[52px] w-16" src="https://taiyaefiles.blob.core.windows.net/web/leaf_d.png"><h2>Leaf</h2><p class="mb-2">A Leaf tries to do what he believes is right, and values both order and personal freedom, whichever is necessary to contribute to good and uphold the natural balance he sees in the world.</p><p class="mb-2">A Leaf appreciates life in all its forms (wolves and other creatures alike). He is happy to stand up for those weaker than him, but also realizes the importance of his own well-being, and so may face a dilemma if forced to choose between the two. He will only kill or harm others out of self defense, and never for pleasure. He will lie only if it's for a good reason.</p><p class="mb-2">He is not inherently for or against authority, as his loyalty and cooperation depend on the situation, and whether or not an organization supports his moral code. He typically defaults to helping and working with others, but may also thrive independently. As a result, he may be easily swayed.</p></div><div class="clear-both"></div><div class="mb-6 overflow-hidden"><img style="margin-top:50px; padding: 30px; width: 125px" alt="Feather Symbol" class="float-right ml-4 mb-2 mt-[52px] w-16" src="https://taiyaefiles.blob.core.windows.net/web/feather_d.png"><h2>Feather</h2><p class="mb-2">Acting according to her conscience, a Feather is kind and benevolent, naturally independent, and makes her own way. She plans little and tends to follow her heart.</p><p class="mb-2">A Feather believes that true satisfaction and happiness are the reasons for living. She tries to do what is good, but may place her own wants and needs above those of another, depending on the situation. She may harm or kill if whatever good she values is at stake, but will rarely do so for no reason. By the same token, she may not always be truthful if lying is necessary for the goal at hand.</p><p class="mb-2">She is likely to believe that there is no natural order to the world, that chaos and chance govern life, and that planning is futile. As a result, she believes that rules are meant to be broken, and may disdain authority if it hinders her freedom. She respects individual life, resents confinement, and values personal liberty above all, believing it to be the path to self-realization.</p></div><div class="clear-both"></div><div class="mb-6 overflow-hidden"><img style="margin-top:50px; padding: 30px; width: 125px" alt="Print Symbol" class="float-right ml-4 mb-2 mt-[52px] w-16" src="https://taiyaefiles.blob.core.windows.net/web/print_d.png"><h2>Print</h2><p class="mb-2">A Print is an individualist first and foremost, and is not naturally inclined toward or against the greater good. He mostly follows his own whims.</p><p class="mb-2">While a Print is not committed to helping others, he may do so if the time is right. He is loyal to himself above all others, and may be either friendly or reclusive, depending on his personality. He may be swayed for or against a common cause, but may abandon it at any time. He may be susceptible to temptation. A Print may kill or harm others if his immediate freedom or happiness is at stake, if those he is close to are threatened, or if he feels it is best for him.</p><p class="mb-2">He likely believes in luck and chance instead of fate, and so tends to act on whims rather than according to any plan. He often takes actions just to see what happens. Because of this, he may not always be reliable. He avoids authority and restriction, respecting absolute freedom instead, and may not respect tradition. Overall, he values his own ability to have a choice in all matters.</p></div><div class="clear-both"></div><div class="mb-6 overflow-hidden"><img style="margin-top:50px; padding: 30px; width: 125px" alt="Fang Symbol" class="float-right ml-4 mb-2 mt-[52px] w-16" src="https://taiyaefiles.blob.core.windows.net/web/fang_d.png"><h2>Fang</h2><p class="mb-2">Motivated by personal gain, a Fang cares primarily about fulfilling his own desires\'97 chaos and disorder among them\'97 in any way he can.</p><p class="mb-2">A Fang serves himself only, and rarely helps others without some ulterior motive behind his actions. He can be easily swayed by hatred or anger, and so may consider the suffering of those he hates as a personal goal. In the same vein, he may crave power and glory, and as a result may achieve it through any means possible. His conscience is grounded in his own motives. He will almost invariably lie to support his goals.</p><p class="mb-2">He is committed to disorder, whether because he is well-equipped to thrive amid chaos, or because he wants to watch the world unfold into chaos. He is opportunistic, valuing his own freedom above all else. He avoids authority unless he is the authority. Conversely, he may be manipulative, whether for personal gain or for amusement.</p></div><div class="clear-both"></div><div class="mb-6 overflow-hidden"><img style="margin-top:50px; padding: 30px; width: 125px" alt="Bone Symbol" class="float-right ml-4 mb-2 mt-[52px] w-16" src="https://taiyaefiles.blob.core.windows.net/web/bone_d.png"><h2>Bone</h2><p class="mb-2">A Bone does whatever she can get away with to advance her own goals, and may choose either independence or cooperation, whichever suits her at the moment.</p><p class="mb-2">A Bone pursues her wants and needs without regard for others, and may help or harm them as she sees fit. If she makes friends, it is normally as a means to an end. She may harm or kill others because she enjoys watching them suffer, or because she has been put to the task by someone else. Alternatively, she may choose not to\'97 in the end, the potential for personal gain is the deciding factor. She has no trouble lying or manipulating to get what she wants.</p><p class="mb-2">She is not inclined toward or against cooperation, and may blend in for self-serving reasons, or alternately, abandon a hierarchy if she must. She may view others as weak or stupid if they fall behind her. She may be eager for power, or may have disdain for it. She may act vengefully if she feels she herself has been wronged, or she may be swayed by others to join or oppose any given cause.</p></div><div class="clear-both"></div><div class="mb-6 overflow-hidden"><img style="margin-top:50px; padding: 30px; width: 125px" alt="Antler Symbol" class="float-right ml-4 mb-2 mt-[52px] w-16" src="https://taiyaefiles.blob.core.windows.net/web/antler_d.png"><h2>Antler</h2><p class="mb-2">An Antler values order and authority, and is methodical rather than merciful or compassionate in serving those to whom he's sworn.</p><p class="mb-2">An Antler values his own life above the lives of others. He may have a strong personal code of ethics that deviates from the norm, or he may be interested in a well-ordered hierarchy because he can exploit it more easily. He has a tendency to cooperate with others if the task at hand supports order, but may do it begrudgingly if it does not support his own goals. He will harm or kill others for personal gain or allegiance, but will rarely lie unless it suits his goals.</p><p class="mb-2">He does not enjoy breaking rules or promises, but is also not above bending the rules if they work in his favor. He is comfortable in a hierarchy, and may be even more comfortable as a leader. He values discipline for himself and others. He may believe in a system of natural law, and so may perceive survival of the fittest as to be an ultimate truth.</p></div><div class="clear-both"></div><div class="mb-6 overflow-hidden"><img style="margin-top:50px; padding: 30px; width: 125px" alt="Eye Symbol" class="float-right ml-4 mb-2 mt-[52px] w-16" src="https://taiyaefiles.blob.core.windows.net/web/eye_d.png"><h2>Eye</h2><p class="mb-2">An Eye acts according to law, tradition, or personal code. She is not naturally inclined toward helping or hurting others, and may do either if it supports whatever law she follows.</p><p class="mb-2">An Eye values both her own well-being and that of others, though when it comes to a choice, she will typically choose the well-being of those she serves. She may be tempted by the idea of power. She will kill or harm others only for loyalty, though anger or revenge may also control her actions. She will never tell a lie unless it supports the good of the order.</p><p class="mb-2">She disdains rebelliousness, as she likely believes all life must have order. She may not value freedom, and so may be seen as stiff\'97 but reliable and honorable nonetheless. She believes that law and order trumps all. She may seek a station or purpose in life. She attempts to act according to plan, and values organization.</p></div><div class="clear-both"></div><div class="mb-6 overflow-hidden"><img style="margin-top:50px; padding: 30px; width: 125px" alt="Stone Symbol" class="float-right ml-4 mb-2 mt-[52px] w-16" src="https://taiyaefiles.blob.core.windows.net/web/stone_d.png"><h2>Stone</h2><p class="mb-2">A Stone has no bias toward helping others or hurting them, or toward order or independence. He follows his own path, and lets the situation at hand influence his actions.</p><p class="mb-2">A Stone does what he wants, and values acting naturally without prejudice for against anything. He may value having a choice between being helpful or self-serving, or he may simply be apathetic towards others in general. He is not inclined toward or against killing or harming others, and if he does so, it may be for personal gain, to serve his pack, or to protect others.</p><p class="mb-2">Depending on his personality, he may believe in either fate or chaos. He is not personally committed to any higher order of life. He may be seen as even-handed and fair, or aloof and detached. He may believe that his is the best way of living. He may be influenced toward or away from any cause, and may or may not be tempted by power.</p></div><div class="clear-both"></div></div>}
